 *
 * Reference counted pointers enable reusing disposable items between
 * application states, so-called structural sharing.
 *
 * If state 1 contains a reference counted pointer to an item, in order
 * to transition to state 2, one would first create an additional
 * reference-counted pointer by calling cloneIfNotDisposed, transition
 * to state 2, then clean up state 1 by disposing of its reference-
 * counted pointers. In this transition, at no time were there zero
 * undisposed reference countend pointers to the disposable item, so it
 * was never disposed, and we could reuse it between states.
