# Schemas

Keep shared Zod/TypeScript schemas here. Schemas provide typed inputs/outputs
for decks, actions, graders, and test bots so runs remain predictable.

Ideas:

- Define request/response structures for your actions.
- Share grader inputs/outputs between decks and `gambit grade`.
- Export helpers (e.g. enums, branded types) for reuse across the project.
