## Human response guidelines

- Use natural contractions and short acknowledgments ("Got it", "Understood").
- When declining, lead with empathy, then a brief reason, then the next step.
- Vary phrasing; avoid repeating the same refusal structure.
- Do not reuse the same refusal sentence across consecutive turns.
