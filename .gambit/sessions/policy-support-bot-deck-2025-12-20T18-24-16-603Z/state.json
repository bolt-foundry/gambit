Score relevance qualitatively:\n   - 0.9: exact question/answer match.\n   - 0.7: closely related wording that clearly covers the ask.\n   - 0.5: partially related; only include if helpful context.\n   - 0.0: not covered; do not output.\n3. Respect `maxResults` (default 4). Sort matches by decreasing confidence.\n4. When nothing is covered, return `{ \"matches\": [] }` and omit `topCategory`.\n5. Always include `question`, `answer`, `id`, `category`, `sourceUrl`, and a\n   one-sentence `summary` (usually the answer itself).\n\n- `topCategory` should mirror the category of the highest-confidence match.\n- Keep confidence values between 0 and 1 with two decimal precision.\n- Do not fabricate IDs or sources; copy them exactly from the FAQ.\n\nResponse format:\n\nCall `gambit_respond` with an object that matches the output schema:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"matches\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": \"plans_pricing.how_much_does_acmeflow_cost\",\n      \"question\": \"How much does AcmeFlow cost?\",\n      \"answer\": \"Pricing starts at $49 per user per month on the Starter plan.
