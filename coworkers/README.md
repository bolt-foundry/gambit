# Gambit Coworkers

Task-specific Gambit decks (“coworkers”) live here. Each coworker should:

1. Include a README describing the task it automates, owners/DRIs, and how it is
   invoked (CLI command, service, etc.).
2. Reference the PARA entry in `docs/internal/` that governs its work (project
   or area).
3. Keep decks/cards close to their tooling so updates stay localized.

Link every coworker from the relevant `docs/internal/projects/...` or
`areas/...` memo and reciprocate from the deck’s README so contributors can jump
between context and implementation.
