# Gambit External Docs Structure

Audience: users, developers, partners.

These docs are polished, opinionated, and user-focused. They should not include
internal debates, open risks, or execution details.

## Structure

- `getting-started/` – first-run setup and quick wins.
- `concepts/` – mental models and design intent.
- `guides/` – task-oriented walkthroughs.
- `reference/` – APIs, CLI commands, and specs.
- `examples/` – curated examples and patterns.
- `posts/` – public updates and launch notes.

## Rules

- Prefer stable guidance over internal context.
- Derive from internal understanding (one-way by default).
- Keep docs tight, actionable, and ready to ship.
