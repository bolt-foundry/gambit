# Gambit External Docs Structure

`docs/external/` contains user-facing Gambit documentation. These docs are
polished, opinionated, and safe to ship to customers and partners.

## Structure

- `getting-started/` – first-run setup and quick wins.
- `concepts/` – mental models and design intent.
- `guides/` – task-oriented walkthroughs.
- `reference/` – CLI, APIs, and specs.
- `examples/` – curated example breakdowns.
- `posts/` – public updates and launch notes.

## README vs ABOUT

- `README.md` files orient readers to the active content in a folder.
- `ABOUT.md` files explain structure rules and conventions.
