# Introducing Gambit Posts

**Published:** 2026-01-19

## What changed

- Created `docs/external/posts/` as the timeline for notable Gambit updates.
- Added guidance on when to publish (launches, milestone wraps, research drops).
- Wired posts to reference the new `docs/internal/` workspace so readers can
  jump from announcements to the living plans.

## Why

We needed a lightweight way to broadcast outcomes without forcing teammates to
trawl every memo. Posts give us a chronological digest while keeping memos
focused on in-progress work.

### …and how it ties to memos

Every post should call out the memo folder that holds the living work (for
example `docs/internal/projects/<project>/`). That memo folder remains the
canonical home for goals, owners, dated updates, and decision logs; the post is
just the snapshot we share when something notable happens.

## Links

- Memo guidelines: [docs/internal/ABOUT.md](../../internal/ABOUT.md)
- Posts guidelines: [docs/external/posts/README.md](./README.md)

## Next steps

- Start a post whenever a memo produces a decision, launch, or summary worth
  sharing.
- Cross-link each new post back to its source memo or project folder so history
  stays connected.
