# Gambit Docs

Gambit is an agent harness framework for building, running, and verifying LLM
workflows. You define decks in Markdown or TypeScript, run them locally with a
CLI and simulator, and capture ground-truth artifacts like transcripts, traces,
and grades. It is deterministic, portable, and stateless by design.
