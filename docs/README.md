# Gambit Docs

Gambit is an open-source, developer-first agent harness framework for building,
running, and verifying LLM workflows. You define decks in Markdown or
TypeScript, run them locally with a CLI and simulator, and capture ground-truth
artifacts like transcripts, traces, and grades. It is deterministic, portable,
and stateless by design.

This folder holds all Gambit documentation sources.

- Coworker execution docs live in `./internal/`.
- User-facing docs live in `./external/`.
- Public posts live in `./external/posts/`.

For structure rules and metadata conventions, see `./ABOUT.md`.
