# Gambit Docs

Gambit is an agent harness framework for building, running, and verifying LLM
workflows. You define decks in Markdown or TypeScript, run them locally with a
CLI and simulator, and capture ground-truth artifacts like transcripts, traces,
and grades. It is deterministic, portable, and stateless by design.

Active docs:

- Internal execution docs: `./internal/`
- External product docs: `./external/`
- Public posts: `./external/posts/`

Structure rules and metadata conventions live in `./ABOUT.md`.
