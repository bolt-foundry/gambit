# Internal Posts Structure

Internal posts are time-bound directives or summaries for coworkers. They
capture orders, updates, and retrospectives without rewriting every project or
area doc.

## Folder structure

- Dated files: `YYYY-MM-DD-<slug>.md`.
- Each post should link to the source project or area docs.
