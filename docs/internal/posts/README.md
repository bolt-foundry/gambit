# Internal Posts

Internal posts are time-bound directives and reports (orders, briefs, decisions,
updates) that summarize what changed inside `docs/internal/` without rewriting
every project or area doc. Think of them as the weekly digest for leadership and
collaborators who want to know how the execution layer is evolving.

Structure rules live in `./ABOUT.md`.

## When to write one

- A project memo hits a major milestone (kickoff, alpha, GA)
- An area establishes a new cadence or playbook worth sharing
- A decision or order needs to be broadcast quickly
- Research in `../resources/` resolves with a clear outcome

## Format

Use dated filenames under this folder containing publish date, summary bullets,
links back to the relevant memo folders, and next steps.

## Publishing

These posts can be surfaced at `/docs/internal/posts` in the docs site for
team-only consumption. Keep sensitive specifics inside the linked memos if
needed, and translate public learnings into `docs/external/` when appropriate.
