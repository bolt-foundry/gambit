# Memo Posts

Internal-only changelog entries that summarize what changed inside
`docs/internal/` without rewriting every project or area doc. Think of them as
the weekly digest for leadership and collaborators who want to know how the memo
layer is evolving.

Structure rules live in `./ABOUT.md`.

## When to write one

- A project memo hits a major milestone (kickoff, alpha, GA)
- An area establishes a new cadence or playbook worth sharing
- Research in `../resources/` resolves with a clear outcome

## Format

Mirror the doc posts format: dated filename under this folder containing publish
date, summary bullets, links back to the relevant memo folders, and next steps.

## Publishing

These posts can be surfaced at `/docs/internal/posts` in the docs site for
team-only consumption. Keep sensitive specifics inside the linked memos if
needed.
