# Resources Structure

Resources are reusable artifacts that support Gambit work without being an
active project.

## Folder structure

- `research/` – experiments, investigations, and benchmarks.
- `runbooks/` – operational playbooks and procedures.
- `templates/` – reusable doc templates.
- `references/` – stable definitions or reference material.
