# Resources

Research notes, experiments, templates, and other reusable artifacts that
support Gambit work but are not active projects.

Structure rules live in `./ABOUT.md`.

Suggested structure:

- `research/` – experiments, investigations, and benchmarks.
- `runbooks/` – operational playbooks and procedures.
- `templates/` – reusable doc templates.
- `references/` – stable definitions or reference material.

## Examples

- Provider investigations or benchmarking results
- Prompting experiments that inform multiple decks
- Templates for specs, runbooks, or launch checklists
- Market/context briefs collected ahead of a project

## Tips

- Keep files date-stamped when possible so we know how fresh the information is.
- Link forward to any project/area that consumes the resource so readers can
  trace adoption.
- Once a resource becomes canonical guidance, move it into `../` docs/ or
  reference it from the right runbook.
