# Gambit Internal Docs (PARA)

`docs/internal/` is where we keep living documentation for Gambit's product and
engineering work: project briefs, cadence notes, decision logs, and research
prep. Treat it as the coordination layer that feeds the rest of the docs folder.
Structure rules and metadata conventions live in `./ABOUT.md`.

Active internal folders:

- `projects/` – active initiatives.
- `areas/` – ongoing responsibilities.
- `resources/` – runbooks, templates, references.
- `posts/` – internal digests and directives.
- `archive/` – completed work.
