# Archive

Completed or deprecated Gambit memos. Keep them here with a short "Final status"
section so future readers know why the work stopped or what shipped.

Structure rules live in `./ABOUT.md`.

- Move entire project/area folders here once their outcomes are recorded.
- Add a dated summary to each archived `README.md` capturing what happened and
  where follow-up work lives now.
- Do not delete historical docs unless they contain secrets—context ages well.
