# Gambit Init Onboarding – Project Index

## Overview

We are turning `gambit init` into a magical, interactive onboarding flow for
technical developers. The init chat should guide users to create their first bot
without writing code, producing a `./root.deck.md` and a test bot in `./tests/`,
while keeping the experience opinionated, fast, and scoped.

- [memo.md](./memo.md) – mission-style brief (purpose, end state, constraints,
  tradeoffs).
- [decisions.md](./decisions.md) – running list of decisions made.
- [context.md](./context.md) – current behavior and code references.
- [non-goals.md](./non-goals.md) – explicit v1 non-goals.
- [risks.md](./risks.md) – known risks to watch.
- [milestones.md](./milestones.md) – short delivery checkpoints.
- [features/](./features/README.md) – feature-level memos.
