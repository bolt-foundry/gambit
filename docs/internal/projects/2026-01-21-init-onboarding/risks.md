# Gambit Init Onboarding – Risks

- Permission scoping is too loose and allows unintended file writes.
- Tooling exposure lets the model write unexpected content without guardrails.
- Init deck prompt quality is insufficient, leading to low-quality bots.
- Missing key path or OpenRouter errors stall the flow.
- Hardcoded filenames conflict with existing user projects.
