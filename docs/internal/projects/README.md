# Projects

Current Gambit initiatives with concrete deliverables and timelines.

Structure rules live in `./ABOUT.md`.

## What belongs here?

- Feature development plans and launch trackers
- Platform migrations or refactors with explicit milestones
- Cross-functional deliverables that require coordination across Gambit repos
- Project-specific meeting notes, specs, and decisions

## Structure

Each active project gets its own folder:

- `project-slug/`
  - `README.md` – snapshot of goal, owners, target dates; keep dated updates
    here
  - `meetings/` – running notes from standups or reviews
  - `specs/` – supporting design docs
  - `decisions/` – dated decision logs / ADRs

We treat this directory list as the canonical "active projects" board. Archive
the folder when the work is complete.

## Not started yet?

- If the effort still needs shaping, capture context under `../areas/` so the
  team can collaborate until scope is clear.
- If it is purely exploratory, stash it under `../resources/` until it is ready
  to graduate into a project.
