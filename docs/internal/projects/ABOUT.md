# Projects Structure

Projects are time-bound missions with clear outcomes.

## Folder naming

- Use `YYYY-MM-<slug>` for ordering and durability.
- Use `YYYY-MM-DD-<slug>` only for short-lived or time-sensitive projects.

## Folder structure

- `README.md` – mission summary and end state.
- `memo.md` or dated updates – decisions and progress over time.
- `risks.md`, `milestones.md`, `non-goals.md` as needed.
