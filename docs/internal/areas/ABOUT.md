# Areas Structure

Areas hold ongoing responsibilities for Gambit. Use them to keep long-running
work visible between projects.

## Folder structure

- `README.md` – purpose and how success is measured.
- `cadence/` – agendas, notes, and rituals.
- `playbooks/` – strategy and guidance for how the area operates.
- `culture/` – historical notes and artifacts that define how the area works.
