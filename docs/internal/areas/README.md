# Areas

Rolling responsibilities, cadences, and shared workspaces that keep Gambit
humming between major projects.

Structure rules live in `./ABOUT.md`.

## Use cases

- Weekly status loops (support triage, release readiness, GTM alignment)
- Practice areas like design system stewardship or documentation quality
- Standing ceremonies with agendas and notes
- Shared plans that multiple projects depend on

## Structure

Inside each area folder, keep:

- `README.md` – purpose and how success is measured
- `cadence/` – agendas, notes, and rituals
- `playbooks/` – lightweight guides unique to the area
- `culture/` – historical notes and artifacts that define how the area works

Areas can spawn projects; just link to the new project folder once it exists.
