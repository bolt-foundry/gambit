# Introducing Gambit Posts

**Published:** 2026-01-19

## What changed

- Created `docs/posts/` as the timeline for notable Gambit updates.
- Added guidance on when to publish (launches, milestone wraps, research drops).
- Wired posts to reference internal execution notes so readers can jump from
  announcements to the living plans.

## Why

We needed a lightweight way to broadcast outcomes without forcing teammates to
trawl every memo. Posts give us a chronological digest while keeping memos
focused on in-progress work.

### …and how it ties to memos

Every post should call out the internal execution notes that hold the living
work. Those notes remain the canonical home for goals, owners, dated updates,
and decision logs; the post is just the snapshot we share when something notable
happens.

## Links

- Memo guidelines: internal policy and memos will be reintroduced alongside the
  Gambit docs reorg.
- Posts guidelines: [docs/posts/README.md](./README.md)

## Next steps

- Start a post whenever a memo produces a decision, launch, or summary worth
  sharing.
- Cross-link each new post back to its source memo or project folder so history
  stays connected.
